# Hangman

This is a command line hangman game. You can play a round or two, save your game, and when you come back you can load up to where you left off.

If you have somehow managed to never play hangman:
  A random word will be selected that is 5 - 12 characters long. You will be shown a string of blanks like so "_ _ _ _ _ ". You will have to guess the letters that make up the word. If you are right, that letter will put in its correct place. Game continues until you've run out of letters or you have found the word. Pretty simple!

Have fun! :)

## Installation
